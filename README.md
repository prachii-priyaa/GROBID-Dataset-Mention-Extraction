# GROBID-Dataset-Mention-

The aim of this project was to extract mentions of datasets from scholarly articles using GROBID, an open-source machine learning tool for parsing and structuring PDF documents. To achieve this, I ran GROBID using a Docker container and parsed the resulting XML/TEI code to extract the mentions of datasets in the article. The extracted data was then stored in an ODF format for further analysis. This project was implemented by utilizing the capabilities of GROBID and Docker to automate the process of dataset mention extraction and facilitate reproducibility. The resulting code and extracted dataset information can be found on the project's Github repository.
